mod_restful - RESTful API for ejabberd
======================================

How to enable
-------------

Add it to a HTTP listener, or add a new HTTP listener:

    {listen, [
              {{8088, {127, 0, 0, 1}}, ejabberd_http,
               [{request_handlers, [{["api"], mod_restful}]}]}
             ]}.

This will open the port 8088 listening on connections only on localhost.
Requests to http://hostname:8088/api/* will be handled by mod_restful.

Configuration
-------------

The module itself is configured separately. Available options are

    {api, [APISpec]}
      APISpec = {Path, Module, [ModuleOptions]}
      Path = [string()] % ["a", "b", "c"] represents a/b/c
      Module = module() % module responsible for requests
      ModuleOptions = any() % module specific options

An example configuration is shown
here:

    {modules, [
           {mod_restful, [
            {api,
             [
              {["admin"], mod_restful_admin, [
               {key, "secret"},
               {allowed_commands, [register, unregister]}
              ]},
              {["register"], mod_restful_register, [{key, "secret"}]}
             ]}
           ]}
          ]}.

This enables two sub paths to two different mod_restful modules:
mod_restful_admin under http://hostname:8088/api/admin and
mod_restful_register under http://hostname:8088/api/register.

mod_restful_admin
-----------------

This module can be used for calling ejabberd commands remotely. Authorization
of requests are by default done via HTTP Basic auth to authenticate a user with
administrative privileges, or, if the key option is enabled, via a shared
secret key.

Request descriptions are done via HTTP POST requests, with a JSON document
describing the request. Two examples of running the command register follows.

To run a command, using admin@localhost:secret as basic authentication.

    POST /api/admin HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.net
    Authorization: Basic YWRtaW5AbG9jYWxob3N0OnNlY3JldAo==
    Content-Type: application/json
    Content-Length: 63
    
    {"command":"register","args":["test","example.net","secret"]}

To run a command, using a shared secret key:

    POST /api/admin HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.net
    Content-Type: application/json
    Content-Length: 78
    
    {"key":"secret","command":"register","args":["test","example.net","secret"]}

When the request is authorized, the result of the command is converted to JSON.
A reply from the server could look like this:

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Length: 54
    Content-Type: application/json
     
    {"ok":"User test@example.net successfully registered"}

Available options:

    {key, Key}
      Key = string() % secret key, used for authorization
    {allowed_commands, [Command]}
      Command = module() % ejabberd_command command

mod_restful_register
--------------------

# Available options

    {key, Key}
      Key = string() % secret key, used for authorization
    private_email

mod_restful_register is an interface to user registration. It provides a
RESTful API registering new accounts, removing existing accounts, changing
passwords of existing accounts, and checking availability of accounts.

Registration, removal and password changes are done with POST requests, while
availability is a GET request. Using JSON, POST requests contain an object
with keys and values. The following table describes required keys for each
type of request.

# Requests

      Request type    | Key          | Description
     ========================================================================
                      | username     | New username
      register        | host         | Hostname
                      | password     | New password
     -----------------+--------------+---------------------------------------
                      | username     | Username to remove
      unregister      | host         | Hostname
                      | password     | Existing password, for authentication
     -----------------+--------------+---------------------------------------
                      | username     | Existing username
                      | host         | Hostname
      change_password | old_password | Old password, for authentication
                      | new_password | New password
     -----------------+--------------+---------------------------------------
      *               | key          | Key used for authorizing the request
     -----------------+--------------+---------------------------------------

     *  - the key can be used to all of the above

# Responses

      Request type    | Response      | Description
     ========================================================================
                      | ok                   | Registration was successful
      register        | email_not_set        | Registered without E-mail
                      | {error, exists}      | Username already exists
                      | {error, Error}       | Registration failed
     -----------------+----------------------+-------------------------------
                      | ok                   | Successfully unregistered
      unregister      | {error, not_exists}  | Username was not registered
                      | {error, net_allowed} | Password incorrect
                      | {error, Error}       | Unregistration failed
     -----------------+----------------------+-------------------------------
                      | ok                   | Password changed
      change_password | {error, not_allowed} | Old password was incorrect
                      | {error, Error}       | Changing password failed
     -----------------+----------------------+-------------------------------


In JSON the form would be either a string, or a map. `ok` would be `"ok"`, and
`{error, not_allowed}` would be `{"error":"not_allowed"}`.

An example session follows:

    POST /api/register/register HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.net
    Content-Type: application/json
    Content-Length: 76
    
    {"key":"secret","username":"test","host":"example.net","password":"secret"]}

If the request was successful, a response looks like this:

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Length: 4
    Content-Type: application/json
     
    "ok"

GET requests differ in that the parameters are provided in the URL. The
available request is the is_registered request, which takes up to three
parameters: key, username and host.

      Request type   | Key          | Description
     ========================================================================
      is_registered  | username     | New username
                     | host         | Hostname
     ----------------+--------------+----------------------------------------

Possible responses:

      Request type   | Response       | Description
     ========================================================================
                     | true           | Username is registered
      is_registered  | false          | Username is not registered
                     | {error, Error} | Some error occurred
     ----------------+----------------+--------------------------------------

Output follows the same rules as the one in the POST requests.

An example session follows:

    GET /api/register/is_registered?username=test&host=example.net&key=secret
    Host: example.net

The response is either true or false (JSON encoded booleans). A response when
the user exists is shown below.

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Length: 4
    Content-Type: application/json

    true

# Hooks

There can be hooks added for plugin style features. Currently the only hook
implemented is `mod_restful_register_registered` which is called when a user
successfully registered a new account. See [mod_private_email](https://github.com/jadahl/mod_private_email) for an example.

A hook must return either the input value (`AccIn`) or key value pair added,
to the beginning of the list `AccIn` (for example `[Foo | AccIn]`). The added
value must be a key, value pair currently only allowing keys of the type
`atom()` and values of either `float()`, `integer()` or `atom()`.

If all hooks return nothing but the input value, the final response of the
register request will be "ok". If else the request will be an object map
consisting of the return values of the hooks.
